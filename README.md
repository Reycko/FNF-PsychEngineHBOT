# HBot - OLD branch.
### 2024 message
Hey, found this shit while looking at my stuff, some stuff to note about this [OLD](/../old) branch.
First, this is for psych 0.5.3b, and secondly, I personally couldn't get this to compile but try to find a guide that's outdated to may 2022 or june 2022 if you want to.
You should use the [remake](/../remake) branch.
